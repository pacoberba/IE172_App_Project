Founded in October 2018 by Malou Perez, Pawssion Project Foundation Inc. is a non-profit organization dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation and rehoming abused, abandoned and neglected animals. Pawssion Project began in Bacolod, armed simply with a lot of hope, courage and the unwavering support of a few good friends. After that first pound rescue, numerous reports poured in one after another, which eventually led to the opening of a second shelter in Bulacan in mid 2019. Since then, the journey has led Pawssion Project to more than 2000 rescues, and thankfully over 1000 rehomed animals."),

Dogs continue to be executed in city pounds, and the number of strays and neglected pets are rising dramatically. But we believe that WE CAN ALL DO SOMETHING to help improve animal welfare in our country. Do not close your eyes to animal cruelty, help spread awareness that there is a law against it (RA8485). Be a responsible pet owner and encourage others to do the same. Promote neutering of pets to help control overpopulation. Adopt, foster, sponsor, volunteer, donate or advocate. Every little action counts."),
